# A devise based rails project with Rails 6

Created this project to practice devise and rspec.
There's a tutorial [here:](https://johnofsydney.github.io/notes/rails/rails_new_project_with_devise.html) which you should read
### A Ruby-On-Rails project with a devise based user model, one associated model and 100% test coverage.

- Ruby 2.6.4
- Rails 6.0.0
- Devise 4.7.1
- Rspec 4.0.0 (Beta2)
- Capybara 3.2.9
- Postgres 10

This repo useful for how to:
- make a rails app with devise. Devise is the industry standard for authentication, but it's not _super_ easy to get started with. Follow the tutorial steps to get an app with devise for users.
- get 100% coverage with your Rspec tests on models & controllers and Capybara for views

### August 2021
Did some updates to rails etc. Tutorial still solid.
